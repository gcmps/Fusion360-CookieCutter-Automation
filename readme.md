Based on PyAutoGUI library that lets you control mouse and keyboard to automate interactions, in this case the code automates the 3D design of a cookie cutter from an .svg file (vector). PyAutoGUI uses X and Y coordinates (may vary from PC) to control mouse position, to know the position there is a Mouse Position.py file.
